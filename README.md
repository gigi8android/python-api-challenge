# python-api-challenge

### Homework Submission
The submission pack is included:
1. *Jupyter notebooks: scrap_WeatherPy_final and scrap_VacationPy_final.* 
    - Note: A sleep clock is set when performing API calls for part1 WeatherPy. API calls will be put on sleep for 60 seconds when a set of 50 cities had been called. A message will be displayed on screen saying "Data Retrieval Completed" when all calls are done. Please refer to the comments embedded in the notebooks for more details.
2. *Output folders:* 
    * *Folder called output_data:* contains csv file that exported from Part1 - WeatherPy (to be used in Part2 - VacationPy)
    * *Folder called output_images:* contains graphs & images exported from Part1 & Part2 of the homework. The heatmap of VancationPy will be exported in html format and hence it won't be displayed appropriately in the jupyter notebook, please open it in the browser instead.
3. *An empty file called api_keys.py* - where api keys for the openweatherMap and google should be stored. This file must be updated with the valid keys prior running the jupyter notebooks, otherwise the programs will be crashed.
