# python-api-challenge

### Homework Submission
The submission pack is included:
1. Jupyter notebooks: scrap_WeatherPy_final and scrap_VacationPy_final [^1]
2. Output folders: 
    - Folder output_data: contains csv file that exported from Part1 - WeatherPy (to be used in Part2 - VacationPy)
    - Folder output_images: contains graphs & images exported from Part1 & Part2 of the homework. [^2] *Note: the heatmap of VancationPy will be exported in html format and hence it won't be displayed appropriately in the jupyter notebook, please open it in the browser instead.*
3. An empty file called api_keys.py - where api keys for the openweatherMap and google should be stored.[^3] *Please update this file with the valid keys prior running the jupyter notebooks, otherwise the programs will crash.*

**Note:** 
[^note]:
[^1]. A sleep clock is set when performing API calls for part1 WeatherPy. API calls will be put on sleep for 60 seconds when a set of 50 cities had been called. The program will display on screen a message saying "Data Retrieval Completed" when all calls are done. Please refer to the comments embedded in the notebooks for more details.
[^2]. The heatmap of VancationPy will be exported in html format and hence it won't be displayed appropriately in the jupyter notebook, please open it in the browser instead.
[^3] Please update file api_keys.py with the valid keys prior running the jupyter notebooks, otherwise the programs will crash due to missing API keys.
